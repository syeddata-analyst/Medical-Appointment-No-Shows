# Medical-Appointment-No-Shows
This project analyzes and predicts patient no-shows for medical appointments.
Description:
This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of medical appointments to understand and address no-shows. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle
 and prepared for analysis using Microsoft Excel.

Data Cleaning & Preparation Steps:

1. Handling Missing Values:

Used Excel filters to identify and manage missing values.

Replaced missing values with appropriate defaults or removed rows when necessary.

2. Removing Duplicate Rows:

Applied Excelâ€™s Remove Duplicates feature to ensure each appointment entry is unique.

3. Standardizing Text Values:

Corrected inconsistencies in categorical data such as gender, country, and other text fields to maintain uniformity.

4. Date Format Consistency:

Converted all date fields to a consistent format (dd-mm-yyyy) for easier analysis.

5. Renaming Column Headers:

Cleaned and standardized column headers by removing spaces, converting to lowercase, and ensuring meaningful names.

6. Fixing Data Types
Ensured numeric fields like age are stored as integers and date fields are stored as datetime values.

This preprocessing ensures the dataset is clean, consistent, and ready for further analysis, modeling, or visualization.
